# meuplanejamento



Meu Planejamento is an open source project. It was first idealized as a management tool for learners that take hard exam contests, like the ones offered in Brazil for candidates who wish to enter the public administration. Overall, public employees have better opporturnites to receive great salaries and financial stability than the private sector.

This web application tracks the time spent in every discipline studied by the candidate. Also, the user can register new displines and consult his/her history of time spent in each topic. This is important to students to keep track of how they are spending their time and of wich discipline they should work more depending on how well they are doing in specific subjects

This web app was developed counting on some technologies, such as:

1 - Python/Flask (back-end management) 

2 - HTML 3 - CSS/Bootstrap

4 - Javascript 

5 - MySql (MariaDB)

It was entirely developed and tested in an Arch Linux system with a pre-configured MariaDB instance.

Also, it was part of my Final Project in Harvard CS50

Hope you like it!
